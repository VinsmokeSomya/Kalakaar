🚀 Thrilled to share my latest project: **कलाkaar (Kalakaar)** - an AI-powered drawing assistant! 🎨✨

Unleash your creativity! Kalakaar lets you sketch freely on a digital canvas and then collaborate with Google's Gemini AI to transform your drawings based on simple text prompts.

🛠️ **Built With:**

*   **Frontend:** Svelte 5 (Runes!) & SvelteKit

This project was a deep dive into Svelte 5, reactive state management with runes, the intricacies of the Canvas API, responsive design for touch devices, and integrating cutting-edge AI models like Gemini.
